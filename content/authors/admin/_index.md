Welcome to my Website! I am currently a Post Doctoral Researcher at Free University Berlin Germany and Guest Researcher at the Berlin Social Science Center (WZB), Germany. I am currently working in the ERC-funded project LOOPS (The Logistics of Popular Uprisings in Competitive Authoritarian Regimes).


Before, I was a PhD Researcher at the European University Institute in Florence, researching  elite communication strategies and their effect on voters. To trace party positions and politicians' language style, I applied a series of computational text analysis tools including machine learning and dictionaries. To test the causal effect of language patterns on voter behaviour, I conducted a survey experiment in the German context. I was also visinting research at the NYU Wilf Family Department.


My research interest lies in the fields of comparative politics and political communication with a focus on computational social science methods.
