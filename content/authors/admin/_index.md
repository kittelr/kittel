Welcome to my website! I am a Post Doctoral Researcher at {{< staticref "https://www.fu-berlin.de/" "newtab" >}}Free University Berlin{{< /staticref >}}, Germany and Guest Researcher at the {{< staticref "https://wzb.eu/en" "newtab" >}}Berlin Social Science Center (WZB){{< /staticref >}}, Germany. I am currently working in the ERC-funded project {{< staticref "https://www.oei.fu-berlin.de/Forschung/loops/index.html" "newtab" >}}LOOPS{{< /staticref >}} - The Logistics of Popular Uprisings in Competitive Authoritarian Regimes.


Before, I was a PhD Researcher at the {{< staticref "https://www.eui.eu/en/home" "newtab" >}}European University Institute{{< /staticref >}} in Florence, Italy. My research focuses on elite communication strategies and their effect on voters. To trace party positions and politicians' language style, I applied a series of computational text analysis tools including machine learning and dictionaries. To test the causal effect of language patterns on voter behaviour, I conducted a survey experiment in the German context. I was also visiting researcher at the {{< staticref "https://as.nyu.edu/departments/politics.html" "newtab" >}}NYU Wilf Family Department{{< /staticref >}}.


My research interest lies in the fields of comparative politics and political communication with a focus on computational social science methods.
